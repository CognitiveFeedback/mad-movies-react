# IMDb Clone

This project is a simplified front-end clone of IMDb, built using React, Next.js, and styled with Tailwind CSS. It is part of the "Next.js Projects - 4 NextJS 14 projects (Instagram, Google.)" Udemy course. This project diverges from the Udemy course in terms of styling and may arbitrarily include additional libraries like babel, shadcn, etc.

## Project Overview

The IMDb clone provides basic features similar to the real IMDb website such as:
- Listing of movies and TV shows
- Search functionality for movies and TV shows
- Detailed pages for each movie and show with ratings, summaries, and cast information

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components
- **React App Router** 
- **API**: Utilizing a movie database API for real movie data
